## Phone Alarm Site
This was something I made for the Object Oriented JavaScript course in 2022. We were tasked by our teacher to create a functional 
alarm clock, complete with a custom sound to play when the set time arrives and an updating time visual. To this end, I modeled mine
after my iPhone and the iOS Clock app, displaying the time and the inputs on it while laying it down on a table. Once the user inputs
a time, it displays the set time under the time like the Clock app does with a timer. Once the set time is reached, the alarm 
goes off and plays a sound. When typing a time, it must be in the 24-hour format and the colon is autofilled. Any invalid inputs are
ignored.
